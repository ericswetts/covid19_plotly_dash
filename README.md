COVID-19 Dashboard

This Plotly / Dash project displays country level descriptive statistics on the COVID-19 pandemic. Aside from common measures used in epidemiology (incidence, mortality, etc.), additional data sources were integrated to provide additional context on each country (such as income range & press freedom scores, among others).

This is a slimmed down version of my previous COVID-19 dashboard project. Note this is solely to illustrate experience with  Plotly / Dash.

Previous versions of this project implemented PostgreSQL & Flask framework to pull up-to-date information. However, this has been deprecated, as there is no reason to maintain this code for a portfolio piece. If you're interested in viewing the code for the previous version, please see: https://github.com/ericswetts/ems-covid19-dashboard.git
